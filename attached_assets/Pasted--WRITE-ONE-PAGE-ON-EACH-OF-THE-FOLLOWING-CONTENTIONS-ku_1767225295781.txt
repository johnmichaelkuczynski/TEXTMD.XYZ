kuczynski | Classical logic fundamentally fails as a tool for reasoning because it requires more intelligence to recognize that an inference instantiates a logical law than to recognize the validity of the inference directly | AI Logic vs Classical Logic
kuczynski | Recognizing an inference's validity is a precondition for knowing that there exists some law of logic that validates it | AI Logic vs Classical Logic
kuczynski | Classical logic operates by explicitly stating laws that validate inferences we already know to be valid, creating a purely formal system that paradoxically cannot help us reason | AI Logic vs Classical Logic
kuczynski | The formal logical system demands more intellectual work than direct reasoning, not less | AI Logic vs Classical Logic
kuczynski | Gödel demonstrated that not even arithmetic is recursively definable, making the reduction of mathematics to logic impossible in principle | Foundations of Mathematics
kuczynski | Logic organizes existing knowledge about what entails what; it cannot generate new knowledge about entailment relationships | AI Logic vs Classical Logic
